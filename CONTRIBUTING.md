# Contributing

ðŸŒŠ Thank you for contributing to Tide! ðŸŒŠ

Please note that this project is released with a [Code of Conduct][]. By contributing to this project you agree to abide by its terms.

If you have any questions that aren't addressed in this document, please don't hesitate to open an issue!

## Code Conventions

### Style Guide

- `if` > `and` or `or`
- `test` > `[...]`
- `printf` > `echo`
- Long forms of flags > short forms
  - Exceptions: `set`, `set_color`, `function foo -a`, "common knowledge" options for commands like `rm -r`
  - Note that MacOS utils often do not support long flags, in which case one should use the short option
- Piping > command substitution (only when convenient, i.e no extra commands)

### Naming Conventions

Local variables should be named in `camelCase`.

- `set -l numberOfNewlines`

Anything exposed to the shell or user--functions, global/universal variables, and files--should be named in `snake_case`, beginning with `tide_`. Prepend an underscore if the user in not meant to interact directly with it.

- `set -g _tide_left_prompt_height`
- `set -U tide_right_prompt_items`
- `_tide_count_left_prompt_height.fish`
- `_tide_right_prompt`

#### Specific Naming Conventions

- Items begin with `_tide_item_`
- Subcommands begin with `_tide_sub_`

## Testing

### Dependencies

- [Fishtape][] - 100% _pure_-Fish test runner
- [Clownfish][] - Override the behavior of commands

You can quickly install the necessary dependencies using `tide test -i`.

`tide test` runs tests from the `$_tide_root/functions/tide/tests` directory.

Example:

```console
tide test status
```

You can run the full test suite with the `-a/--all` flag.

```console
tide test -a
```

Some tests are designed for a CI machine and will not necessarily run on any working Tide install. These tests can be run using the `--CI` flag.

## Linting

Code linting is done via [`fish --no-execute`][].

Markdown and Yaml linting is done via the [Super-Linter][] action, which uses [Markdownlint][] and [Yamllint][].

## Formatting

Code formatting is done via [`fish_indent`][].

Markdown and Yaml formatting is done via [Prettier][].

## Documentation Conventions

All links should be in the [reference style][], with references at the bottom of the document in alphabetical order.

## Release

Note that Tide does not use strict semantic versioning.

Todo on release:

- [ ] Update version number in install `tide.fish`
- [ ] Make a commit containing above edit, titled with the version number
- [ ] Create release on github with information from changelog
